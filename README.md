📊 Marketing Campaign Analysis with React and Data Storytelling
Welcome to my data exploration project where I dive into a rich marketing campaign dataset using JavaScript, React, and Recharts to uncover customer behavior insights. This project transforms raw data into compelling visualizations and a narrative-driven article, designed to guide strategic marketing decisions.
🔍 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a marketing campaign dataset, revealing patterns in customer spending, purchase behavior, and campaign effectiveness. The insights are visualized through interactive charts and shared in a storytelling article suitable for platforms like Medium and LinkedIn.
I focused on answering the following business questions:

Which countries have the highest average customer spending?
How does education level influence purchase rates and spending?
Which age groups drive the most spending, and how do they respond to campaigns?
Which marketing campaign achieved the highest success rate?
Are there untapped opportunities in specific demographics or regions?

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

JavaScript & React: For building an interactive web-based report with dynamic visualizations.
Recharts: For creating responsive bar, line, and pie charts to visualize key insights.
PapaParse: For parsing and processing the CSV dataset.
Tailwind CSS: For styling the report with a clean, modern look.
GitHub: For versioning and hosting the project.
CSV File: The raw dataset containing customer demographics, spending, and campaign responses.

🧾 Dataset
The dataset, marketing_campaign_data.csv, includes 2,240 customer records with the following key fields:

Demographics: Year of Birth, Education Level, Marital Status, Annual Salary, Children/Teens at Home, Country.
Spending: Electronics, Toys, Furniture, Utilities, Food, and Clothing.
Behavior: Number of Discount, Web, Catalog, and Store Purchases, Website Visits per Month.
Campaigns: Responses to five marketing campaigns (Campaign_1_Purchase to Campaign_5_Purchase) and overall purchase status (Purchased).

📈 Key Insights

Portugal Leads in Spending: Customers in Portugal have the highest average spending, making it a prime target for high-value campaigns.
Doctorate Holders Convert Best: Customers with a Doctorate degree show the highest purchase rate, despite lower average spending, suggesting targeted campaigns for this group could drive conversions.
Older Customers Spend More: The 61+ age group has the highest average spending, likely due to greater disposable income, indicating potential for premium product campaigns.
Campaign 2 Shines: Campaign 2 achieved the highest success rate (~5.6%), offering a model for future campaign strategies.
Hidden Gem in Chile: Customers with elementary school education in Chile show surprisingly high purchase rates despite lower spending, revealing an untapped market for budget-friendly offers.

These insights are visualized in an interactive HTML report featuring bar charts (spending by country, purchase rate by education), a line chart (spending by age group), and a pie chart (campaign success rates).
